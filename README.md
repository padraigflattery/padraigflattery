# 👋 Hi, I’m Pádraig

I use Python and R for climate projects.

This page tracks my active and "Stable" repos. 

Every day's a school day.

## 📝 How I work
- Python: `uv`/`pip-tools`, black/ruff; R: renv.  
- Data: NetCDF/Zarr preferred; versioned in DVC or tagged releases.

> **Update routine:** add new rows to the table, keep “Status” emoji up to date, and add links to demos/docs when relevant.
