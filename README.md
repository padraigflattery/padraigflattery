## 👋 Hi, I’m Pádraig

I use Python and R for climate projects.

This page tracks my active and "stable" repos. 

I tend to code using Jupyter Notebooks in Python, and RStudio for R. I'm learning more about Flask and Shiny to make things more interactive. 

I use [JupyterHub on the ECMWF ATOS](https://jupyterhub.ecmwf.int/) and have code stored there too, which should be tracked with git someday.
